= Vale for VSHN

This project generates a ready-to-use installation of the https://github.com/errata-ai/vale[vale], a "syntax-aware linter for prose built with speed and extensibility in mind."

This image is geared specifically to verify Asciidoc files using the Microsoft, Openly and built-in Vale text style rules. It contains:

* https://github.com/errata-ai/vale[vale]
* https://github.com/errata-ai/Microsoft[Microsoft style rules]
* https://github.com/testthedocs/Openly[Openly style rules]
* https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor]

== Usage

Use it as follows, for example on an Antora project root, to verify all Asciidoc files in that folder:

[source,bash]
--
podman run --rm --volume "${PWD}"/src/modules/ROOT/pages:/pages --workdir /pages ghcr.io/vshn/vale:2.15.5 --minAlertLevel=error .
--
