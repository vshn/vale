= Vale for VSHN

This project generates a ready-to-use installation of the https://github.com/errata-ai/vale[vale tool], a "syntax-aware linter for prose built with speed and extensibility in mind."

This image is geared specifically to verify Asciidoc files using the Microsoft, Openly and built-in Vale text style rules. It contains:

* `vale`
* https://github.com/errata-ai/Microsoft[Microsoft style rules]
* https://github.com/testthedocs/Openly[Openly style rules]
* https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor]

== Usage

Use it as follows, for example on an Antora project root, to verify all Asciidoc files in that folder:

`docker run --rm -t -v $(pwd)/modules/ROOT/pages:/pages vshn/vale /pages`

You can also specify an individual file instead of a whole folder:

`docker run --rm -t -v $(pwd)/modules/ROOT/pages:/pages vshn/vale /pages/file.adoc`
